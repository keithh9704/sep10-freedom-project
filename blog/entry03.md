# Entry 3: Creating a Timeline of Different types of Animation 
##### 12/18/23
### Context
After writing entry 2 I organized a timeline for how old was a certain software and/or hardware was and put the app/item on a timeline. Originally I didn't have enough information to put on my website so I quickly did some more research and discover many animations that were modern or from the past.
### The Timeline
I started looking at the time of which animation was the earliest and which was more modern and what I found was surprising to me was how old animation was. 
#### Past (1700-1999)
The first animation to exist was the zoetrope and praxinoscope which i talked about which i talked about in my [last entry](entry02.md) and I expected this to be the oldest since It uses paper to make an illusion. The next oldest thing surprised me because it was a flipbook. I thought flipbooks were invented in the recent years since I seen still being used to this day. Claymation models came after and this was went disney was born and they used claymation models to make animations on our favorite cartoon characters and shows. 
#### More modern (2000-2023)
When coming to the year 2000s technology got more advanced that we can make animations using a green screen which helps you create the background to whatver you want. We use softwares to make the green screen at it's full potental and to make softwares to it's full potental you need processor, Network attached storage so you can have many backups, a good graphics card and a good driver to render your animations. This also invented stop motion and with the green screen and all these computer pieces it can make animation really smooth. Another thing I found cool was during the present the computer can make a animation off of an image.    
#### In the Future (2023-Future)
After making the timeline of the currect animations devices or illison I had 4 ideas on what maybe the future of animation will be.
* My First idea was a camera with 
automatic green screen and This would maybe make filming a lot more realistic and the actor can move a lot more than before.
Also maybe it could make editing the background more easier.
* My Second idea was adding on into making an image into a animation but you give this an ending result and you can change the animation to your desire.
* My Third Idea is similar to the second idea but instead of being an image itÂ´s a program that makes an animation off of a sentence or a statement. you can also change the animation to your desire
* My last idea was making an ai that has human traits and this ai can react to the scene or sentence at hand. They can also voice act some characters of the animation.
