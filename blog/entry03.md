# Entry 3: Creating a Timeline of Different types of Animation
##### 12/18/23
### Context
After writing entry 2 I organized a timeline for how old a certain software and/or hardware was and put the app/item on a timeline. Originally I didn't have enough information to put on my website so I quickly did some more research and discovered many animations that were modern or from the past.
### The Timeline
I started looking at the time of which animation was the earliest and which was more modern and what I found was surprising to me was how old animation was.
#### Past (1700-1999)
The first animation to exist was the zoetrope and praxinoscope which i talked about which i talked about in my [last entry](entry02.md) and I expected this to be the oldest since It uses paper to make an illusion. The next oldest thing surprised me because it was a [flipbook](https://i.etsystatic.com/5233040/r/il/d6f066/4484474178/il_1588xN.4484474178_6qkg.jpg). I thought flipbooks were invented in the recent years since I seen still being used to this day. [Claymation models](https://get.pxhere.com/photo/film-canon-blue-toy-50mm-ae1-canonae1-figurine-kodak-clay-ektar-kodakektar100-canonfd50mmf14-50mmprime-wallaceandgromit-claymation-393416.jpg) came after and this was went disney was born and they used claymation models to make animations on our favorite cartoon characters and shows.
#### More modern (2000-2023)
When coming to the year 2000s technology got more advanced that we can make animations using a [green screen](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Green_screen.jpg) which helps you create the background to whatver you want. We use softwares to make the green screen at it's [full potental](https://www.awn.com/sites/default/files/styles/inline/public/image/featured/53128-all-world-s-virtual-stage-disney-s-new-camera-capture-system.jpg?itok=M2w4JaxQ ) and to make softwares to it's full potental you need processor, Network attached storage so you can have many backups, a good graphics card and a good driver to render your animations. This also invented stop motion and with the green screen and all these computer pieces it can make animation really smooth. Another thing I found cool was during the present the computer can make a animation off of an image.   
#### In the Future (2023-Future)
After making the timeline of the current animations devices or illusion I had 4 ideas on what maybe the future of animation will be.
* My First idea was a camera with an automatic green screen and This would maybe make filming a lot more realistic and the actor can move a lot more than before.
Also maybe it could make editing the background more easier.
* My Second idea was adding on into making an image into an animation but you give this an ending result and you can change the animation to your desire.
* My Third Idea is similar to the second idea but instead of being an image it's a program that makes an animation based on a sentence or a statement. you can also change the animation to your desire
* My last idea was making an ai that has human traits and this ai can react to the scene or sentence at hand. They can also voice-act some characters in the animation.
### Engineering Design Process
During the time between entry 2 and entry 3 we went through step 3 which was brainstorming possible solutions and I brainstormed possible inventions that animation could have in the future. We are currently on step 4 which is planning out the solution and I planned out 4 ideas that were a camera with an automatic green screen, making an image and an ending result into an animation, Making an animation off of a sentence and AI having human traits. The next step of EDP (Engineering Design process) is creating a prototype of the problem.
### Skills
The skills I learned were a deeper understanding on how to research/googling things I need to prepare for a website. I also communicated with people on slack to see if my future ideas of animation were good and what I should add on.   
#### Researching/googling
I wanted to get images for my website but I couldn't find any that wasn't just an image so I asked my cousins on how to do so. They told me that I could go to the website and right click the image and click the open link to another tab and copy and paste that link.
#### Communication
As I mentioned earlier I asked my cousins for help on getting images which increased my knowledge of helping me google things. I also sent my ideas on slack and I reflected on the feedback I received to make another idea of animation of the future.


### Next Steps
I wonder how I am going to create a solution to my problem since I am not sure If I am going to actually create the solution in real life or a bootleg version on the computer.
