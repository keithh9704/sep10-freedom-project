# Entry 2: The Software and Hardware of Animation
##### 11/27/23
### Context
After writing blog one I researched apps and hardware that could help with visual learners that aren't really known in the world.
#### Software
There are things called [zoetrope and praxinoscope](https://www.linearity.io/blog/early-animation-devices/) that people don't know really well since they are really early animation devices that tells a story or shows a character moving around making an action that can have a deeper meaning. Other than things made by humans most people do or do not know that green screens can make your favorite disney or tv show. The reason why is because when you record something with a [green screen](https://darvideo.tv/dictionary/green-screen-editing) it can show you in a place that is impossible to see if you recorded by hand.
#### Hardware
After researching what zoetrope and praxinoscope does, I looked up the [hardware](https://collections.museumsvictoria.com.au/articles/2908) of those inventions. Zoetrope is a cylinder shaped invention that has a paper inside of the wall which creates an illusion that looks like paper or an image is moving. I later found out that Praxinoscope is a remade version of zoetrope with some additions such as mirrors in the circumference of the cylinder to make the image or a paper move more clear for the audience to see. When using green screen on a computer you can put any background and you the person can act like you are in the background.
### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on the 2nd stage of the engineering design process and The stage is about researching the problem that I defined during stage one. When researching the problem I found an invention that most people don't know that well. It was called a zoetrope which was a cylinder shaped illusion that looked like an animation by spinning the cylinder. The next step of the engineering design process is to brainstorm possible solutions with the information I found that are not really well known in the world.
### Skills
I improved in searching for the topic but my communication has remained the same from the last entry.
#### Researching/googling
When I found the software of something that wasn't really known to the world like the zoetrope invention I went to specifically look up hardware of zoetrope. Same with the green screen but more people know about the green screen then knowing about the zoetrope.
#### Communication
I haven't really communicated after making the first blog but I was told to try to research things that are not really known in the world because the website I am going to make in the future is going to be useless if people already knew how to solve the problem and knew about the solutions to the problem.  
### Next Steps
I am curious on how I am going to brainstorm solutions to my problem which is how we do help visual learners learn the things they want to learn.
