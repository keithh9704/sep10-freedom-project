# Entry 2: The Software and Hardware of Animation
##### 11/27/23
### Context
After writing blog one I researched apps and hardware that could help with visual learners that aren't really known in the world. 
#### Software
There are things called zoetrope and praxinoscope that people don't know really well since they are really early animation devices that tells a story or shows a character moving around making an action that can have a deeper meaning.
#### Hardware
After researching what zoetrope and praxinoscope does, I looked up the hardware of those inventions. Zoetrope is a cylinder shaped invention that has a paper inside of the wall which creates a illusion that looks like paper or an image is moving. I later found out that Praxinoscope is a remade verison of zoetrope with some additions such like mirrors in the circumference of the cylinder to make the image or a paper move more clear for the audience to see.
