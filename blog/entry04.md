I saw the tool aframe and I tickered with it which led me to stick with this tool.   
I used jsbin to use the aframe commands which were
```

      <a-cylinder position="0.5 0.6 -3" radius="0.3" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-cylinder position="-0.5 0.6 -3" radius="0.3" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>

This code makes a person out of shapes. I tried to make things rotate and change the position of the cylinders so they act like arms and legs. For the body I made the box float up in the air and make the box looked like it's attached to the cylinders which are the arms and legs. For the head I made the sphere float above the square and made the sphere radius a bigger than any other shape.    
I learned all this from a [sildeshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nsptrTVH5fI2NpvmmE3PffaUNODlpyxpB-LgH4Eko5A/edit#slide=id.g84acedc9de_0_70) that was a workshop made up from bayside high school and the slides helped me how to use aframe at a really basic level.
