I saw the tool aframe and I tinkered with it which led me to stick with this tool.  
I used jsbin to use the aframe commands which were

      <a-cylinder position="-0.5 0.6 -3" radius="0.3" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>

This code makes a person out of shape. I tried to make things rotate and change the position of the cylinders so they act like arms and legs. For the body I made the box float up in the air and make the box look like it's attached to the cylinders which are the arms and legs. For the head I made the sphere float above the square and made the sphere radius bigger than any other shape.    
I learned all this from a [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nsptrTVH5fI2NpvmmE3PffaUNODlpyxpB-LgH4Eko5A/edit#slide=id.g84acedc9de_0_70) that was a workshop made up from bayside high school and the slides helped me learn how to use aframe at a really basic level.
### Skills
I learned how to problem decomposition since this would help me to use the code at hand and I also worked on creativity because instead of just showing floating shapes I thought maybe I could make a person out of shapes.
#### Problem decomposition
I went on the slides that bayside high school made and I was really confused on what the code does even though the explanation was really simple to understand. So instead of doing nothing I tried each part of the slideshow on [jsbin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,output) and everything made sense after i tried aframe out.
#### Creativity
After I learned all the basic codes that make use of aframe I thought that I didn't just want to make shapes rotate and float in the air and say I tinkered with the aframe tool. I could make a person out of shapes and after a lot of trial and error I made a person and I felt really good about myself.
### Next steps
After learning and using aframe at a really basic level I wonder how am i going to use this on my website and the things I will make in the aframe space.
