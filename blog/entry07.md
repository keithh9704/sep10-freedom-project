# Entry 7
##### 5/31/24

### Context
After presenting my website to the whole class, my teacher and to a lot of people in the expo including the principal. This was a really fun learning experience since this gave me exposure to public speaking which I found really nerve wracking but as I presenting to more and more people I got used to the feeling and turned the experience to a happy experience.
### In-Class presentation
After I was done doing [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UXiFxFk7Ry688JfwIaKWPsnIpOsqpvgscL0ZG3oBrEw/edit#slide=id.g2ddf02d20b4_0_2) I thought I took too long to present my website and I saw myself stuttering and talking a bit too fast on explain what aframe is and how it connected to blender. I was nervous my hands and body was shaking but I pushed thought and got where I am today.
#### Takeaway From In-Class presentation
When you are doing public speaking try to ignore the fact that you are showing your presentation to people. Try to focus on yourself and talk at a pace people would understand you.
### Expo Presentation
Although doing the [expo presentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gOTbU3gWlS_M0NR9PrOCabqtd15Nd8c9dd9059KdhQ/edit) was a fun experience, there was this one moment when presenting to people I would freeze and panick/zoneout on what I was suppose to say. Luckly the 8-10 people I was presenting to were really patient with me and let me collect my thought and clapped for me when I finished.
#### Expo Presentation Takeaways
* Don't be so nervous about presenting what you worked on and worry that people would feel disappointed, Atleast you had the courage to show your ideas. 
* When you are trying to explain something don't just say uhhhh. Stop quickly collect my thoughts.
### Engineering Design Process
As of Today 6/1/24 I finished the 8th/last step of the edp which is commmunicating the product and I presented to my whole class and many juniors, senior and the principal of the school.

### Skills
While the time between the blog 6 and 7 I enhanced my Communication skills and Having a growth mindset.

#### Communication
As I said earlier I presented to many people during my expo and each time I would try to think how I could get better before the next group of people come to my website. So I came up with a lot of ideas to incourage myself to keep going such as "there is no harm into sharing your ideas" and/or "this is easy since you are familiar with this content".
