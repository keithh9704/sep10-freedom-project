# Entry 7
##### 5/31/24


### Context
After presenting my website to the whole class, my teacher, and to a lot of people at the expo including the principal. This was a really fun learning experience since it gave me a lot of exposure to public speaking which I found nerve-wracking. Still, as I presented to more and more people I got used to the feeling and turned the experience into a happy experience.
### In-Class presentation
After I was done doing [class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UXiFxFk7Ry688JfwIaKWPsnIpOsqpvgscL0ZG3oBrEw/edit#slide=id.p) I thought I took too long to present my website and I saw myself stuttering and talking a bit too fast on explain what aframe is and how it connected to blender. I was nervous my hands and body were shaking but I pushed through and got where I am today.
#### Takeaway From In-Class Presentation
When you are doing public speaking try to ignore the fact that you are showing your presentation to people. Focus on yourself and talk at a pace people would understand you.
### Expo Presentation
Although doing the [expo presentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gOTbU3gWlS_M0NR9PrOCabqtd15Nd8c9dd9059KdhQ/edit) was a fun experience, there was this one moment when presenting to people I would freeze and panic/zone-out on what I was supposed to say. Luckily the 8-10 people I was presenting to were patient with me, let me collect my thoughts, and clapped for me when I finished.
#### Expo Presentation Takeaways
* Don't be so nervous about presenting what you worked on and worry that people would feel disappointed, At least you had the courage to show your ideas.
* When you are trying to explain something don't just say uhhhh. Stop quickly collect my thoughts.
### Engineering Design Process
As of Today 6/1/24, I finished the 8th/last step of the EDP which is communicating the product and I presented it to my whole class and many juniors, seniors, and the school principal.


### Skills
During the time between blogs 6 and 7, I enhanced my Communication skills and my growth mindset.


#### Communication
As I said earlier I presented to many people during my expo and each time I would think how I could get better before the next group of people came to my website. So I came up with many ideas to encourage myself to keep going such as "_there is no harm in sharing your ideas_" and/or "_this is easy since you are familiar with this content_".


#### Growth mindset
My cousins that I hadn't seen in 5 years came to New York and I visited them at my grandma's house and had a lot of fun like going to Dave Busters. On the way back home I asked them if they had any ideas on how I should present my website and I would show them my website. They would suggest speaking loudly, looking at your audience, and not being too shy to be overly excited to present your website. So I took that advice with my twist and the presentations went well.


### Next Step
Sadly I wasn't one of the top 3 or an honorable mention but I am proud of myself and going to sep11 I am curious about the limits of javascript and the pros and cons.
