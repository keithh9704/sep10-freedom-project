# Entry 1: Choosing Animation as my main topic 
10/24/23
### Context
Looking at the different topics to pick for the freedom project Game development stood out to me the most but it wasn't available. I looked at my 2nd option which was __Animation__ and I was pretty intersted in animation when i first saw it. All the impact frames and cool effects that gives up which makes me want to make one someday. I looked up just animation a lot of things came up. I clicked the [First link](https://www.chitkara.edu.in/blogs/applications-of-animation-in-current-world-scenario/#::text=Animation) I saw that wasn't just images. The article explains that animation can be spilt into five parts education, entertainment, architecture, business and branding and marketing. The catagory that caught my eye was the architecture  since I don't really see architecture in animations that I watch.
