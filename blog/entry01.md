# Entry 1: Choosing Animation as my main topic 
10/24/23
### Context
Looking at the different topics to pick for the freedom project Game development stood out to me the most but it wasn't available. I looked at my 2nd option which was __Animation__ and I was pretty intersted in animation when i first saw it. All the impact frames and cool effects that gives up which makes me want to make one someday. I looked up just animation a lot of things came up. I clicked the [First link](https://www.chitkara.edu.in/blogs/applications-of-animation-in-current-world-scenario/#::text=Animation) I saw that wasn't just images. The article explains that animation can be spilt into five parts education, entertainment, architecture, business and branding and marketing. The catagory that caught my eye was the architecture  since I don't really see architecture in animations that I watch.



### Engineering Design Process
I am in the first stage during engineering design process and this stage is about defining a problem within animation. The problem we have is that people are visual learners and we need more visual animations to show people how to learn the thing you wanted to learn. The next step could be researching the problem from articles and talking to peers how we can solve this problem.

### Skills
Skills that I learn from doing this topic is communication and researching

##### Communication
When I thought about the problem for animations I was stunned a bit since I couldn't think of one. I asked my cousin's for an idea and I brought up education. My cousin said maybe we should help visual learners and It clicked for me so I went with that.

##### Researching 
When I googled animation I saw things I was interested about like at the first link it told me a lot of about animation I didn't know about. I would research them too and I would learn a lot about animation that can be used in different ways.

### Next Step 
I am excited to research this topic to the furthest and make innovations on solving this problem.
