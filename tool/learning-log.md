# Tool Learning Log

Tool: **Aframe**

---
**Using Src can make any shape the image you presented**   
**ONLY WAY U CAN USE SRC IS WHEN YOU UPLOADED AN IMAGE**
#### Positioning:
* -X makes the shape go to the left
* X makes the shape go to the right
* -Y makes the shape go down
* Y makes the shape go up
* -Z makes the shape go forward
* Z makes the shape go backward
* 
#### Shapes (will add more soon)
* Cone
* Sphere 
* Cylinder
* Plane (the "floor")
* Box
* Triangle
* Curvedimage
* Circle
#### Functions:
* There is different parts of aframe you could use to make backgrounds. After installing the part you could
* The a-sky repersents the background so you could make the background whatever color you want.
* Putting components like sphere cylinder inside an `<a-entity></a-entity>` could be used to add a css element to every component that is in the `<a-entity></a-entity>`.
* Using `<a-camera></a-camera>` you can use the x y and z in postioning to choose where the user will see your website from.


Things I tried:
* changing colors, increasing/decreasing the sizes of the shape,
* The shapes are called entities
* trying out different shapes that are not given to you when you paste in the code to tinker with aframe
* Using Src to make really funny things to show my friends
