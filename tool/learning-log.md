Position:
* -X makes the shape go to the left
* X makes the shape go to the right
* -Y makes the shape go down
* Y makes the shape go up
* -Z makes the shape go forward
* Z makes the shape go backward

Things I tried:
* changing colors, increasing/decreasing the sizes of the shape,
* The shapes are called entities
